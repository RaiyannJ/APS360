DualNet - Predicting House Prices with Images and Numerical Data

Our group is implementing a dual CNN and ANN (MLP) network to accurately predict house prices using both images and numerical data! This will be compared against a common baseline model for predicting house prices on only numerical data (CSV file) - Multiple Linear Regressions. We are implementing an M.S.E. loss function with Adam optimizer. Over 15,000 houses were analyzed.

All our data was treated carefully, removing outliers and extra attributes. Data was also normalized and loaded correctly. Data processing was done with Python and Sheets.

A final percent error of 32% was achieved, almost 10% better than our baseline model! Further finetuning and hyperparameter edits can be made to increase accuracy.
